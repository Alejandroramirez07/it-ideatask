        "\n",
        "This project applies the AI Fluency Framework’s 4Ds—Delegation, Description, Discernment, and Diligence—to the automation of JUnit 5 test creation using AI. The goal is to reduce manual testing time while maintaining high-quality, comprehensive test coverage for Java classes. The outcome includes generated JUnit test code, documentation, and a reusable prompt workflow.\n",
        "2. Delegation\n",
        "\n",
        "Delegation involves selecting the right AI tools and defining clear roles for human–AI collaboration. In this case, the AI (ChatGPT, GPT-5) is responsible for generating, refactoring, and documenting JUnit tests, while the human developer provides source code, validates outputs, and integrates the generated tests into the project.\n",
